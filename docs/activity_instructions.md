# Project File Structure Activity

![an image of a calculator](calculator.jpg)

For this activity, the objective is to re-organize the files in this repo so they are organized in accordance with best practices.

After re-organizing the files, it will also be necessary to update the imports in the program (.py) files so the tests may run successfully.

To check if the tests are running as expected, run the following command:

```
pytest test_X.py
```

Replace X with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. If the file you are testing is nested in a sub-directory, please remember to cd into the directory before running the command.

Once the tests are running correctly, please also create the following for the project:
* A README file explaining the project and how the modules can be used
* A .gitignore file
* Choose a license for the project

You can find hints to get you started in the [hints.md](hints.md) file.
