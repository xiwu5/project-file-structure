# Hints

Here are some common sub-directories found in projects:

Directory Type | Description | Common Names
---    | ---  | ---
Assets | This directory may contain items such as images for a project, favicons, type fonts, etc | assets, resources, static
Source Code | The code for a project typically live in this directory | src, project name (i.e. calculator)
Tests | The tests for a project typically live in this directory | test(s)
Elaborate Documentation | Some projects may require multiple files to document the in-and-outs of how to utilize or contribute to the project. They would be housed under this type of directory. This file (hints.md) is the type of file you may find in this type of directory. | docs, project-docs

Please keep in mind that not *all* files will need to be placed into sub-directories.
